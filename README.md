# Planetary-Confusion-Audio-Visualizer
This is my Week4- Week6 project for MUSIC 256A ( Audio Visualizer)

This is simply an audio visualizer. You can play songs and see how the application reacts to the song inputs. Currently I just have one song
in the playlist which gets triggered by the up key. This visualizer can also analyze live audio input. 

There are two kinds of visualization :

1. Time Domain (Seen as the movement in the magnetic field of the earth and the death star that if not excited cannot be seen otherwise (so 
play loud music to see its reality) ) . The volume of the audio controls also the speed of the planets. 

2. Frequency Domain - The FFT is laid out on the saturn rings all around. The FFT also warps the wire mesh frame planet's shape according to 
the FFT magnitude. 


Granulated Song: If you press the down key the input song is granulated and you can change the grainular synthesis parameters by pressing the 
right key and by the movements of the planets. 

I have used the following addons :

1. ofxFFT
2. ofxStk
3.ofxParticles
